## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
To see how different car measurements affect MPG measurement, we ran a standard linear regression.

* Accoring to P-value measurements (P<0.05) we can see that Vehicle length and Ground clearance play the biggest role in MPG. 
* Due to our low p-vaule, we can conclude a non zero-slope.
* Statiscally, we can conclude that Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance will have the highest correlation with MPG about 71 percent of the time. 

## Suspension Coil PSI Statistics
To pass our standards, PSI on a coil must not exceed 100 PSI

* As seen, in total our variances meet this guideline, however...

* When broken down by lots, Lot 3 does not pass.
